<p style="font-weight: bold;">Family is one of the most 
important. Taking time every day to appreciate our loved 
ones for all that they do helps us to reconnect as a family. 
I cannot imagine living my life without my family by my 
side. Family is very important and valuable to me and is 
something that should never be taken for granted. Without my 
family, a large part of my life and culture would be missing.

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><i><q>Being a family means you 
are a part of something very wonderful. It means you will 
love and be loved for the rest of your life. â€“ Lisa Weed</i>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"> This is about my family 
member. My father's name is Mazuki Bin Abd Rahman and 
he is a police pensioner. He was a good and resolute father.
My mother's name is Faimah Binti Samat and she is a nurse 
pension. She was a good, gentle mother and supportive 
mother. I only have three siblings which is one brother 
and one sister. I'm the youngest sister in my family. My 
brother's name is Ahmad Syahir Bin Mazuki and he works as 
a shop assistant at an advertising store owned by my uncle 
in Kelantan. My sister's name is Nursyahirah Binti Mazuki 
and she works as a front office at a resort in Kuantan. Both 
my brother and my sister are already married and when both 
of them are not home, only me and my parents live at home. 
In spite of our long distances we remain together no matter 
what. We always help each other and stories together. I'm 
grateful and proud to be in this little family.</p><center>
