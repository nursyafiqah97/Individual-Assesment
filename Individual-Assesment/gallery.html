This is my gallery. All of these picture are when me and my 
classmates were attend our convocation day (Diploma in 
Office Management and Technology) and also the pictures of 
our pre-convocation at UITM Kampus Dungun. The three 
pictures above are a pre-convocation photo of me and my 
classmates on the beach facing UITM. We chose the beach in 
front of UITM as our memories together after struggling for 
two and a half years to graduate successfully. Next, the 
three pictures below are pictures of me, my classmates and 
my lecturer who also as advisor at UITM on our convocation 
day.<h2>
