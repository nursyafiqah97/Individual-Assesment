I didn't have any experience in the field of work since I 
graduated of Diploma in Office Management and Technology. 
Possibly, it is not my turn to work yet and "we only plan,
God determines everything". I believe that one day there
will be opportunities for me to work even I have no 
experience in any field of work. However, God's plan is 
better because I have the opportunity to continue my studies 
at the level of Bachelor in Office Systems Management. I'm 
still trying to find a job that suits my field of study and 
other fields even though I have continued my studies. I 
still apply and will try to get it. I not only apply in my 
own state but also in other states. I will use all the 
knowledge I gained while pursuing my diploma studies in 
searching job. I will also use my existing skills and 
ability to fill a position in any company to help them 
achieve their goals and objectives.</p>
<p>These are activities and co-curriculum that I join while 
in school and at university. There were many bitter and 
sweet experiences that I had while following all these 
activities and co-curricular activities.<p>
